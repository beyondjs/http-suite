3. **Improvement Points:**
    - **Method Refactoring:** Some methods are lengthy and perform multiple tasks. They could be divided into smaller
      functions to improve readability and maintainability.
    - **Enhanced Typing:** Leverage TypeScript to define more explicit and specific types, which would help prevent
      errors and improve clarity.
    - **Error Handling:** Implement more robust error handling, especially in asynchronous and streaming operations.
    - **Optimization of `getHeaders` and `formData`:** These methods could be more efficient and clearer in their logic.
    - **Consistent Use of Async/Await:** Ensure that all asynchronous operations use `async/await` for consistency and
      readability.
    - **Separation of Responsibilities:** Consider dividing the `JCall` class into smaller classes, each focused on a
      single responsibility (e.g., handling headers, form data, etc.).
    - **Nomenclature Review:** Some variable and method names could be more descriptive to more clearly reflect their
      purpose.
    - **Documentation:** Add comments and documentation to explain complex logic and design decisions.
